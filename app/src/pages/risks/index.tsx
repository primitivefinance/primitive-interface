        <StyledTitle>Risks of Using Primitive Finance</StyledTitle>
        <StyledSpacer size={24} />

        <StyledText>
          There are smart contract and economic risks in every interaction with
          the protocol.

        <StyledSubtitle>Admin Keys</StyledSubtitle>
        <StyledSpacer size={24} />
        <StyledText>
          The Primitive V1 Option has no admin functions. Every Externally Owned
          Account and smart contract has the same permission status. This also
          means that the core Option contract cannot be paused.
        </StyledText>
        <StyledSpacer size={24} />
        <StyledText>
          The Primitive Option Factory contract has an admin-controlled function
          to pause FUTURE deployments of Options. This will only be in the BETA
          Option Factory contract, and will be removed after the contracts have
          been battle-tested for several months. The factory has no control over
          Options which have already been deployed.

        <StyledSubtitle>Security Audit</StyledSubtitle>
        <StyledSpacer size={24} />
        <StyledText>
          Primitive's core contracts have been audited:{' '}
          <Link href={auditLink}>
            <StyledNavItem>Phase 1 Audit.</StyledNavItem>
          </Link>
          <StyledSpacer size={24} />
          Audits do not guaranteeÂ  security of the contracts. The contracts
          should never be considered 100% secure. Assume a contract is insecure
          unless it has been battle-tested for more than 12 months.

        <StyledSpacer size={24} />

        <StyledSubtitle>Development Cycle</StyledSubtitle>
        <StyledSpacer size={24} />
        <StyledText>
          Contracts are first designed and initially implemented in prototypes.
          Those prototypes will never see mainnet in their first form.
        </StyledText>
        <StyledSpacer size={24} />
        <StyledText>
          After the prototyping stage, another round of upgrades to the
          contracts occurs to prepare them for testnet. Contracts will live and
          be redeployed to testnet prior to being sent for audit.
        </StyledText>
        <StyledSpacer size={24} />
        <StyledText>
          The code is then frozen, the contracts are sent to auditors, and the
          testnet contracts will continue to be used for further testing. After
          the auditors have taken several weeks to review them, they will
          recommend changes which are then implemented by the core Primitive
          developers.
        </StyledText>
        <StyledSpacer size={24} />
        <StyledText>
          After the audit changes have been implemented, the core Primitive team
          reviews the overall security and preparedness for maintaining the
          production contracts. Once the team has decided that the contracts are
          ready, they are deployed to mainnet.

        <StyledSubtitle>Liquidity Provision Risks</StyledSubtitle>
        <StyledSpacer size={24} />
        <StyledText>
          Options are volatile instruments, which means losses can accrue
          quicker when they are provided as liquidity to Automated Market
          Makers, such as Uniswap.
        </StyledText>
        <StyledSpacer size={24} />
        <StyledText>
          As a liquidity provider to a Uniswap option token {'<>'} stablecoin
          pair, you are directionally exposed to the option. This requires
          proper hedging to remain neutral. Options need to have their price,
          volatility, and time risks hedged.
        </StyledText>
        <StyledSpacer size={24} />
        <StyledText>
          If an option is expired and a Uniswap pair has a balance of the
          expired option, the other reserve of the pair can effectively be
          drained (bought using an option worth $0.00).

        <StyledSubtitle>Non-Standard ERC-20 Risks</StyledSubtitle>
        <StyledSpacer size={24} />
        <StyledText>
          The Primitive V1 Option uses a novel accounting method for tracking
          its internal balances. Non-standard ERC-20 token implementations with
          rebase functions (YAM, AMPL, etc.) alter balances, which could break
          the core internal accounting methods. Rebasing tokens have not been
          verified as a secure asset to use as an underlying token in a
          Primitive V1 Option.
        </StyledText>
        <StyledSpacer size={24} />
        <StyledText>
          ERC-20 tokens which have fees taken out on transfer (deflationary) can
          alter balances, which could break the internal accounting methods of
          the Primitive V1 Opti0n.
        </StyledText>
        <StyledSpacer size={24} />
        <StyledText>
          Some ERC-20 implementations do not return true or false, or any data,
          after a transfer method has been completed. Primitive V1 Option has
          safety mechanisms (Open Zeppelin's SafeERC20 Library) in place to
          guard against any side-effects of this non-standard ERC-20 function.
